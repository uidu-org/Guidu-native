You can work on a specific packages. PRs including stories and tests are more likely to be merged.

```

We manage versions with `@changesets/cli`. If you want a package to be published on npm, you can do so by running

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .
# Prepare a changeset
yarn changeset
# Follow the instructions choosing patch, minor or major
git push origin feat-button
```
